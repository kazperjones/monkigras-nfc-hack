# monkigras-nfc-hack

## What?

Generate beautifully unique Spirographs from MOO NFC cards and get them posted to you on Twitter!

A quick beer and cheese filled hack from @omerk, @exo and @darach, Monki Gras 2016

Based on nfc-reader by @nadam and spiroID by Matt Medland, Chris Roberts and co. at TinkerSoc.

Shoutout to Kernel Brewery and Raw Cheese Power for the lucid cheese dreams and the will power to hack.


## How?

MOO NFC cards, used on the great Jukebox hack have unique URL's encoded in them. We extract that NDEF record
and pass it along to spiroID (which is a Processing hack) alongside your Twitter ID. We then use that unique ID
as the seed for the spirograph, generate a PNG with some funky colours and upload it to Twitter with a mention
to you. 

Grab some MOO Jukebox cards and find us to try it out!
